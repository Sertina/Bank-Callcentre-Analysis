Bank Call Centre Analysis and Process Improvement


The project - The WeGotBank Call Center vision is to use automation to increase customer service levels by reducing the time taken to address the caller’s request (call handling time), improve sales by having more relevant information at the agent’s fingertips, reduce/eliminate the time required to update a customer’s personal information in multiple systems, and overall, positively impact the employee’s experience by making it easier for them to perform their jobs.
The aim is to have all the conversations personalized to enhance the customer experience, ensuring that the member has all the information and products needed to be successful in their financial goals.
